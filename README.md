# Maxwell J. Pembo
# FPGA-Oscilloscope
FPGA based Oscilloscope and Function Generator using VHDL and C. Project for Advanced Embedded Systems Class.


### Project Features
- Created Oscilloscope from FPGA that takes signal in from boards audio input port. 
    - Implemented in VHDL 
- Created Function generator that outputted signals using boards audio output port
    - Created Using the Microblaze softcore processor, coded in C
    - Held library of functions in FPGA BRAM

- Outputted a video display using the boards HDMI port that showed incomming wave
- Listened to commands to control the function generatior and the oscilloscope via the boards UART
